# A very simple Gobang game written in pure C++

 1. It's easy to run. I use vscode + mingw64 + make

 2. makefile is responsible for explaining what to compile, or `g++ *.cpp` in the terminal directly is OK as well

 3. pay attention that "w"(width) means the number of columns on the chessboard,and "h"(height) means the number of rows on the chessboard
